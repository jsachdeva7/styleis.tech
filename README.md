# 🧥 styleis.tech — Style Meets Sustainability

> **Fast Fashion is killing the planet.**  
> styleis.tech (Style-is-dot-Tech) is a full-stack web app that helps users track their outfits, get insights on what they *don’t actually wear*, and encourages sustainable behavior by recommending local donation options.

---

## 🌍 Inspiration
Most of us own clothes we never wear — yet someone out there could really use them.  
We built **styleis. tech** to close that loop: help people understand their real clothing habits and make donating easy, accessible, and data-driven.

---

## 💡 What It Does
- 👕 **Document Outfits:** Users can log what they wear each day.
- 🔍 **Reality Check:** The app analyzes usage over time and identifies underused clothes.
- 🎁 **Smart Donations:** Recommends local donation centers where those clothes could go.
- 📦 **Donation Basket:** Users can review, confirm, and prepare their donation list with a single tap.
- 🌤 **Bonus:** Integrates weather and location APIs for smart outfit recommendations.
